## OverView
AcitivityGO was created to help users find activities within a selected area and budget. Users can select an activity from the list to view more details such as price, date and number of spots available. The listed activities can be added to their favorites for future reference or booked immediately.

ActivityGO allows users to do a quick search instead of having to scroll through many different websites to find activities that match both the desired location and their budget.
